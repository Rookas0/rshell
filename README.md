I'm writing this shell in C for learning purposes.

Current features
* Line editing with arrow keys and delete
* Quotes for multi-word tokens 

Currently working on
* Implement parser and command tree for piping and IO redirection
* At some point need to stop expecting good input
    * Ex: Unbalanced quotes.
